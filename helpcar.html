<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You decide to go save the person in the car, but you must work quickly before the car explodes. You go to the car door and open it, and you see a middle-aged man in a suit who seems to be unconscious. You unbuckle his seatbelt and grab the man's body, and you proceed to put him down on the sidewalk about 50 feet from the car. A few seconds later, the car explodes after the gasoline catches on fire. The crowd of people that were talking before start running away after the explosion. Your hair gets slightly hinged by the heat of the detonation. But, in the corner of your eye, you see a briefcase on the road next to the burning car, and you conclude that the case was most likely in the car with the man. What will you do next? </div>
