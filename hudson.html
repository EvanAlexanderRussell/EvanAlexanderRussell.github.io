<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You walk over a mile because you feel like swimming in the Hudson. Like many other things that you have done today, this is a very quick and impulsive decision, almost like your every thought is being controlled by someone else. Anyways, you dive in the Hudson and immediately die from the amount of pollution in the water. <br> <br> Go Back? </div>
