<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You ignore the crashed car and you walk towards the crowd to see what is going on. You assume it is just a crowd of worried people like you wondering why NYC was nuked or if a world war had just started. But, when you look closer you realize it is a bunch of doomsday preppers with guns. One of them sees you, shouts something unintelligible, and they all turn around and light you up. The last thing you hear is someone shout, "HAH, got him real good!" and you die. <br> <br> Go Back? </div>
