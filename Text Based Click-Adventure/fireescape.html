<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You decide that taking the fire escape is your best option to get down to ground level. It takes about 5 minutes, but you reach the alley after jumping off of the ground ladder and you walk over to the sidewalk. You can see that nearly every glass window on your street has been shattered. There are also noticeable cracks on some of the older concrete buildings. You then look right and see a large crowd of people outside who all look very scared about the nuclear blast that has hit the city. Looking left, you see a car that appeared to have crashed into a building. The car seems to be leaking gasoline and the puddle of gas on the ground is flowing close to a fire set on the building. There is a man sitting in the driver's seat. You must think fast about if you should save the man, or do something else. </div>
