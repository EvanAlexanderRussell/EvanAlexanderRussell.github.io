<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You for some reason desperately crave a Cheezburger at that exact moment, which prompts you to avoid everyone else in the area and immediately hop into a conveniently running car near you. You speed over to McDonald's and get into the drive-through lane, and then instantly remember that a nuclear explosion took place 10 minutes ago and the McDonald's is empty. You get out of your car and you jump into the building using a broken window and then make 15 Big Macs for yourself. After you finish eating, you notice an extremely convenient hazmat suit in the freezer. You put it on and decide what to do next. </div>
