<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You slap the man in the face about 20 times before he regains consciousness. When he opens his eyes and sees you, he groans in pain and says something in Russian. When you don't respond, he says more stuff in Russian, but louder this time. After you don't respond for a second time, he looks around and sees the briefcase next to you. Without hesitation, he whips out a Makarov and shoots you in the head, and you die. <br> <br> Go Back? </div>
