<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You are sleeping in your NEW YORK CITY flat. It is currently 7 in the morning, and the sun is begining to rise. You awake to a very bright flash which prompts you to look out your window. You see a large MUSHROOM CLOUD rising from Central Park, and a few seconds later, a shockwave shatters your window and mildly injures you. You decide that you must escape your flat NOW. <br> <br> Make your decision. </div>
