<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You open the briefcase and you find an envelope full of Russian nuclear launch codes and a paper with all the possible escape routes from NYC. After reading a bit more, you find out that the U.S. and Russian governments agreed to nuke Manhattan in order to prevent any more pollution from being created in the city, so they disregarded the 1.5 million people living there for the sake of preventing climate change. You then burn that incredibly important document and hop in your car to escape the city.  <br> <br> You Win! </div>
