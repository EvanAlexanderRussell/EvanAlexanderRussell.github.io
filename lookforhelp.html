<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You ignore the burning car along with the crowd of people, and you start to wander around the streets of NYC. You walk towards Times Square and you see plenty of people along the way who are very confused and scared about the situation they are in. Once you reach Times Square about an hour later, you see nobody around and no help in sight. As you succumb to radiation poisoning, your last thought is "I want a Cheezburger," and you die. <br> <br> Go Back? </div>
