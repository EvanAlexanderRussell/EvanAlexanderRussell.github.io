<h1>Apocalypse Survival Simulator</h1>
<div>You begin to climb down the stairs, but by the time you are on floor 3, you hear cracking sounds coming from the walls. You rush down the last few flights and nearly trip a few times, but you eventually get out of the building through the back entrance. You run about a block from the building and turn around just in time to see the building collapse. You also find a convenient hazmat suit on the ground and you put it on. You must decide what to do now.</div>
